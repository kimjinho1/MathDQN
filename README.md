## MathDQN

The research paper [MathDQN: Solving Arithmetic Word Problems via Deep Reinforcement Learning](https://aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI18/paper/view/16749) has been accepted at the Thirty-Second AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence (AAAI-18).

## Requirements (Original):

- Tensorflow 1.2.1
- Python 2.7


## Run
To run the experiment with default parameters:

```
    python DQN.py 0(fold number)
```

Now, we only provide code for dataset AI2.(code for other two datasets will be integrated in this code soon)

## Dataset

### AI2
* [Learning to Solve Arithmetic Word Problems with Verb Categorization](https://www.cs.washington.edu/nlp/arithmetic)
* [code (Java)](https://www.dropbox.com/s/dl/1slbq2fi77fq7wx/Java%20code_mathproblems.zip)
